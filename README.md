Swarm-Cars
==========

Embedded AVR project for flocking cars.

A video of these cars in action can be seen here:

## Implementation files
The files in the /Vicon directory are files that can be implemented on the Vicon system to perform the flocking behavior "IRL".

## Simulation Files

The files under /Simulation are files for simulating the flocking and grouping behavior.  Since this project is (moving to) open source, the code is being migrated from Matlab to Python.
